# Motion_Detector
A simple motion detector from this tutorial: 
www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/05/25/basic-motion-detection-and-tracking-with-python-and-opencv/

I was amazed how such a simple algorithm can be used for a workable motion detector.

Requirements:

1. Python 2.7  (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7)

2. OpenCV 2.4.X  (How to install and integrate it with Python for Windows: http://opencvpython.blogspot.ca/2012/05/install-opencv-in-windows-for-python.html)

3. Python moudles: imutils, numpy (Install using pip: pip install imutils; pip install numpy)
